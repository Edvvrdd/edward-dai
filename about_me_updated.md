# Updated About Me Section

## Version 1: Balanced Technical + Creative (Recommended)

I am a technical sound designer with a unique perspective shaped by completing multiple games independently across the full development lifecycle. This hands-on experience across programming, design, and audio has given me deep insight into how sound design integrates with every stage of production, enabling me to collaborate effectively with engineers, designers, and artists while anticipating technical requirements and creative opportunities.

My expertise centers on creating interactive audio systems using FMOD, Wwise, and game engines including Unreal Engine and Unity. I specialize in designing responsive, data-driven soundscapes that adapt dynamically to player actions and environmental factors. Beyond implementation, I approach sound design as world-building—crafting emotionally resonant audio experiences through careful attention to subtle details that enhance immersion. I believe great game audio shouldn't just sound impressive in isolation; it should make players feel fully present in the game world.

My technical knowledge allows me to push beyond traditional linear sound design, creating highly interactive and detailed audio that responds intelligently to gameplay. From field recording and original sound creation to optimizing audio pipelines and integrating middleware, I prioritize developing scalable solutions that serve both the creative vision and the practical needs of small to mid-sized teams. I am particularly drawn to studios where sound plays a defining role in the game's identity, and where experimentation and close collaboration are valued throughout the creative process.

## Version 2: More Concise & Direct

I am a technical sound designer who brings a distinctive advantage to game audio: I have completed multiple games independently, giving me comprehensive understanding of the full development lifecycle. This experience enables me to collaborate seamlessly with engineers, designers, and artists while anticipating how audio integrates with every production stage.

I specialize in creating interactive audio systems using FMOD, Wwise, Unreal Engine, and Unity. My approach combines technical implementation expertise with a world-building philosophy—I focus on subtle details and emotionally resonant sound design that creates immersive player experiences. Rather than audio that simply sounds impressive, I craft soundscapes that make players feel fully present in the game world.

My work spans field recording, original sound creation, adaptive audio systems, and middleware integration. I excel at developing data-driven, responsive audio that adapts dynamically to gameplay, pushing beyond traditional linear sound design. I am particularly interested in collaborating with small to mid-sized studios where sound design shapes the game's identity and where experimentation and iteration are core to the creative process.

## Version 3: Lead with Unique Differentiator

Having completed several games independently from concept to release, I bring an unusually broad perspective to technical sound design. This full-cycle development experience means I understand not just audio implementation, but how sound integrates with programming, design, and production workflows—enabling me to collaborate effectively across disciplines and contribute strategically throughout development.

I specialize in creating interactive, emotionally resonant audio systems using FMOD, Wwise, Unreal Engine, and Unity. My approach treats sound design as world-building: I focus on subtle details and adaptive systems that create immersive experiences where players feel present in the auditory environment rather than simply noticing "cool sounds." My technical knowledge allows me to design highly responsive, data-driven audio that goes beyond traditional linear sound design.

My expertise includes field recording, original sound creation, middleware integration, and audio pipeline optimization. I am passionate about solving technical challenges while maintaining creative vision, and I thrive in collaborative environments where sound plays a central role in defining the game's identity. I am particularly drawn to small and mid-sized studios that value experimentation, iteration, and close teamwork throughout the creative process.

## Comparison with Current Version

### Current (Line 118 of index.html):
- Length: ~140 words
- Strengths: Technical focus, mentions data-driven systems, team collaboration
- Weaknesses: Doesn't mention specific tools (FMOD/Wwise/UE/Unity), lacks unique differentiator, missing emotional/creative dimension, no mention of field recording or full dev cycle experience

### Recommended Update (Version 1):
- Length: ~175 words
- Additions: Full dev lifecycle experience, specific tools (FMOD, Wwise, UE, Unity), field recording, "emotionally resonant," world-building philosophy, subtle details focus
- Maintains: Technical expertise, data-driven systems, team collaboration, scalable solutions
- Better alignment: Gardens Interactive (emotionally resonant, field recording, Wwise), Playrix (FMOD + expressive), indie studios (full dev understanding)

## Implementation Notes

**Recommended**: Use Version 1 as it provides the most comprehensive coverage while maintaining professional tone.

**Alternative**: Version 2 if you prefer more concise (better for mobile/quick scanning).

**Alternative**: Version 3 if you want to lead very strongly with your unique differentiator.

All three versions address the key gaps identified:
✅ Mentions Wwise (not just FMOD)
✅ Includes field recording
✅ Emphasizes full development cycle experience
✅ Adds "emotionally resonant" language
✅ Mentions Unreal Engine and Unity explicitly
✅ Highlights detail-oriented, world-building approach
✅ Maintains technical credibility while showing creative vision
