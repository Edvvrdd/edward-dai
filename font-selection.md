**Option 3** is warmer and more approachable, great for collaboration-focused roles.  
**Option 6** has a more futuristic, gaming-industry feel that directly connects to your field.

## How to Choose

Just let me know which option number you prefer (1-6), or if you'd like to mix and match (e.g., "Use Poppins for headings with Roboto for body text"), and I'll apply it throughout your entire site!
